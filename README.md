##  Technical Comparison & Use Case Report

### Overview

This report compares three key blockchain platformsâ€”**Ethereum**, **Hyperledger Fabric**, and **Quorum**â€”each suited to distinct use cases based on decentralization, security, and control.

- **Ethereum** is a leading **public blockchain** with smart contract support (Solidity, Vyper), native token (ETH), and an open, decentralized environment. It's best for applications that require trustless global access like decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and public dApps. However, its base layer throughput (~15â€“30 TPS) can be a bottleneck, mitigated via Layer 2 scaling solutions.

- **Hyperledger Fabric** is a **private blockchain** tailored for enterprise use. With its modular architecture, pluggable consensus, and support for private data channels, it enables high throughput (1000+ TPS) and controlled accessâ€”making it ideal for supply chains and multi-organization business processes.

- **Quorum**, a **consortium blockchain**, extends Ethereumâ€™s functionality with features for regulated industries. It supports private transactions, enterprise-grade consensus (Raft, IBFT), and EVM compatibility. This makes Quorum well-suited for interbank transactions, compliance-heavy finance, and consortia use cases.

### âœ… Best Platforms by Use Case

- **Decentralized Application (DApp):**  
   **Ethereum** â€” open access, token economy, and smart contract ecosystem.

- **Supply Chain Among Known Partners:**  
   **Hyperledger Fabric** â€” high throughput, private channels, and permissioned model.

- **Inter-bank Financial Applications:**  
   **Quorum** â€” privacy, Ethereum-compatible smart contracts, and enterprise consensus.
